    <p class="description">Agriculture plays a vital role in India‟s economy. The Indian agriculture system began as early as
        9000 BC. During this period techniques were developed for the settled mode of production in
        agriculture and wheat, barley and jujube were the popular crops that were domesticated in the
        subcontinent by 9000 BC. The farm sector is contributing greatly to the productivity and stability of
        the country's economy due to which it has been believed that agricultural prosperity is fundamental to
        national prosperity. It accounts for about 18% of India‟s gross domestic product, provides
        employment to 58 per cent of her working population
        and the rural households depend on agriculture
        as their principal means of livelihood. Agriculture, along with fisheries and forestry, is one of the
        largest contributors to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). <br>

       <br> New techniques were developed in the Neolithic period to improve the method of agriculture system
        like threshing, planting crops in rows, cotton spinning and storing grains in granaries. And they
        passed their improved techniques of agricultural production to the next generation. This
        transformation of knowledge was the base of further development of agriculture in India. The
        recognition of the origins and the historic, non environmental limitations on distribution of useful
        plants which arises from such study has many practical applications today.4 Hence, it is pertinent to
        study the system of Indian agriculture in ancient times. </p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Ancient Indian Agriculture System in Indus Valley Civilization</h1>

    <p class="description">Indus Valley civilization relied on the considerable technology achievements of the pre-Harappan
        culture, including the plough. The farmers of the Indus Valley grew peas, sesame and dates. Rice was
        also cultivated in the Indus Valley Civilization. The method of agriculture which Indus civilization
        people practiced was rainfall harvesting. Due to discovery it came into the light that Indus civilization
        people had a series of massive reservoirs to meet the city‟s needs during the dry season. The main basis 
        for the Indus valley economy was mixed farming. Irrigation was developed in the Indus Valley
        Civilization by around 4500BC. As a result of this innovation in irrigation, the size and prosperity of
        the Indus civilization was grown. Sophisticated irrigation and water storage systems were developed
        by the Indus Valley Civilization, including artificial reservoirs at Girnar dated to 3000 BC and an
        early canal irrigation system in 2600 BC.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Ancient Indian Agriculture in Vedic Period</h1>

    <p class="description">Cultivation of a wide range of cereals, vegetables, and fruits was common, and animal husbandry was
        the important means for their livelihood. There was belief that those farmers who are near to nature
        they must be exceptionally close to God. The importance of seeds was emphasized and a certain
        sequence of cropping was recommended and the practice of preparation of manure by the cow dung
        for irrigation was common during this time.
        </p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Ancient Indian Agriculture in Mauryan Empire</h1>

    <p class="description">The Mouryan Empire (322-185BCE) categorized soils and made meteorological observations for the
        agricultural use. Other Mauryan facilitation included construction and maintenance of dams and
        provision of horse-drawn chariots which was quicker than traditional bullock carts. The Greek
        diplomat Megasthenes (300BC) in his book Indika provides an eyewitness account of Indian
        agriculture at that time. <br>

        <br> He writes, “India has many huge mountains which abound in fruit-trees of every kind, and many vast
        plains of great fertility. The greater part of the soil is under irrigation and consequently bears two
        crops in the course of the year. In addition to cereals, there grows millets and different sorts of pulse
        and rice throughout India. Since there are two monsoons in the course of each year the inhabitants
        gather in two harvests annually.”
        </p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Ancient South Indian Agriculture</h1>

    <p class="description">The agriculture scene of South India was equally bright in Ancient India. The south people cultivated
        a wide range of crops such as rice, sugarcane, millets, black pepper, various grains, coconuts, beans,
        cotton, tamarind and sandalwood, jackfruit, coconut, palm, areca and plantain trees etc. systematic
        ploughing, manuring, weeding, irrigation and crop protection was practiced for sustained agriculture
        in South India. Water storage systems were designed during this period. Kallanai (1st
        -2
        nd century AD),
        a dam built on river Kaveri is considered the as one of the oldest water-regulation structures in the
        world that is still in use.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Ancient Indian Agriculture in Chola Period</h1>

    <p class="description">The agrarian society in South India during the Chola Empire (875-1279) reveals that collective
        holding of land slowly gave way to individual plots, each with their own irrigation system during
        Chola rule. The Cholas also had bureaucrats which oversaw the distribution of water, particularly the
        distribution of water by tank-and-channel networks to the drier areas. The growth of individual
        disposition of farming may have led to a decrease in areas of dry cultivation. <br>

      <br>  The Indian economy in the pre-British period consisted of isolated and self-sustaining villages on the
        one hand, and towns, which were the seats of administration, pilgrimage, commerce and handicrafts,
        on the other. Means of transport and communication were highly underdeveloped and so the size of
        the market was very small. To understand the agriculture system in pre-British India, it is essential to
        study the structure and character of the village community, the character of internal and foreign trade,
        the state of the means of transport and communications.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Agriculture System during the British Period</h1>

    <p class="description">The British rule can be divided into two epochs, first the rule of the East India 
        Company ranging from 1757 to 1858, and second, the rule of the British Government in India from 1858 
        to 1947. The establishment of the British rule itself was a slow and lengthy process, extending over more than a
        hundred years. The British conquest which started in 1757 with the Battle of Plassey was completed
        only by 1858. During this period England was passing through the period of changes in the techniques
        of production which revolutionized manufacturing. The British conquest led to the disintegration of the
         village community partly by the introduction of the new land revenue system and partly by the
        process of commercialization of agriculture. The new land system and the commercial agriculture
        meant untold exploitation of the Indian peasantry and the country was consequently plagued by
        frequent famines. The British were not interested in developing India as such. The growth of railways
        or the spread of irrigation or the expansion of education or the creation of revenue settlements were all
        initiated with one supreme goal, i.e., to accelerate the process of economic drain from India. <br>

      <br>   One of the important contributions of the anglo-saxon period is the institution of local government.
    During this period, the majority of the population lived in small villages‟ and agriculture being their
    principal occupation. Each village formed a township and was a unit of local government.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">THE LAND SYSTEM DURING 1793-1850</h1>

    <p class="description">The important impact of the British rule is the growth of a new land system in India. In the early
        period of the East India Company rule, the Company directors were keen on securing the largest
        possible revenue. This policy was marked by excessive exactions from peasants not realizing that in
        the process the British were killing the goose that laid the golden egg. But land revenue was a
        principal source of finance for Company administration in India as also of satisfying the Company
        directors in England with larger returns every year from their conquest of India. In order to bring
        about stability in agriculture the British introduced land settlement in 1793. In Bengal and
        neighboring areas „permanent settlement‟ was introduced. The settlement raised the status of revenue
        collectors to that of private landlords. It fixed land revenue in perpetuity. This was called Zamindari
        system and the zamindar was required to deposit an enhanced land revenue to the state. Later the
        British extended the settlement to other states and created zamindars there too but they changed over
        to „temporary settlement‟ under which land revenue could be reassessed after a period ranging
        between 25-40 years in different states. <br>

        <br> Another and a totally different land system was evolved for large parts of Bombay and Madras and
        subsequently extended to north-eastern and north-western India. According to this system, called the
        ryotwari settlement, each peasant holding a plot of land was recognized as the land lord and made
        directly responsible to the state for the annual payment of land revenue. <br>

        <br> It may be pointed out that in both cases, the land rents fixed were excessive and both the system were
        instrumental in the destruction of the organic village community based on custom and tradition.
        Daniel and Alice Thorner write: “Whereas the zamindari system made the land lords masters of the
        village communities, the ryotwari system cut through the heart of the village communities by making
        separate arrangements between each peasant cultivator and the state.” Through the introduction of
        zamindari system, the British were able to create a class of people whose interests were directly tied
        to British rule in India. But the system helped to create a class of absentee landlords who were more
        interested in squeezing higher land rents than in real agricultural progress. Excessive pressure of
        population resulting in a high demand for land helped the zamindars to charge exorbitant rent and
        numerous other exactions from the tenant-cultivators. The result of the whole change in the land
        system led to the emergence of subsistence agriculture. Even the ryotwari-system lost its original form
        and the rigorous, prompt and inelastic demands of high revenue forced peasant-cultivators to sell land
        to absentee landlords or moneylenders. The British land system introduced by Lord Cornwallis, thus
        helped the concentration of economic power in the hands of absentee landlords and moneylenders in
        rural India. It depressed agriculture and the peasantry.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Commercialization of Agriculture (1850-1947)</h1>

    <p class="description">Another noteworthy change in Indian Agriculture was its commercialization that spread between 1850
        and1947. Commercialization of agriculture implies production of crops for sale rather than for family
        consumption. At every stage of the economic history of the nation, a part of the agricultural output is
        produced for the market. Then, what distinguished commercial agriculture from normal sales of
        marketable surplus? It was a deliberate policy worked up under pressure from British industries. By
        the middle of the nineteenth century, Industrial Revolution had been completed in England. There was
        a tremendous demand for raw materials, especially cotton, jute, sugarcane, groundnuts, for the British industries. By offering a higher bait of market price, the peasants were induced to substitute
        commercial crops for the food crops as the former were more paying than the latter. Consequently, the
        peasants shifted to industrial crops and in some districts, the movement for commercial agriculture
        became so strong that the peasants started buying food stuffs from the mandis for their domestic
        needs. This led to a fall in the production of food and, consequently this period is marked by the
        occurrence of most terrible famine in the economic history of India. Commercial agriculture was also,
        to some extent, the result of the mounting demands of the land revenue by the state and excessive
        rents by the landlords from the peasantry. <br>

         <br> The process of commercial agriculture necessitated by the Industrial Revolution was intensified by the
        development of an elaborate network of railway in India after 1850. Railways linked the interior of
        the country with ports and harbours, urban marketing centres and thus Indian agriculture began to
        produce for world markets. Large quantities of wheat from Punjab, jute from Bengal and cotton from
        Bombay poured in for export to England. The same railways which carried commercial crops from
        the various parts of the country brought back the foreign machine-made manufactures to India. Thus,
        railways and link-roads connecting the hinter-land of country with commercial and trading centres
        were instrumental in intensifying commercial agriculture on the one hand and sharpening competition
        of machine-made goods with Indian handicrafts, on the other. These factors led to the ruin of Indian
        industries.
        </p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">The New Land System</h1>

    <p class="description">The British created a class of landlords so as to affix responsibility for land revenue, but the British
        left the process of rent fixation to the free market mechanism. The increasing demand for land for a
        growing agricultural population led to an exorbitant increase in rents. Land was transformed in this
        process to an attractive capital asset. Thus, there was a great desire among the money lending classes
        to acquire land. The rise in prices of land enhanced the value of the security in the form of land
        against which peasants could borrow. This led to increase in agricultural debt of the Indian peasantry
        repeatedly exposed to uncertainties. The high rates of interest charged by the money lending classes
        made it impossible for the peasants to repay their debts. Gradually lands passed on to the money
        lending classes. The dispossession of the peasantry by the money lenders added to the process of
        pauperization of the cultivating classes. <br>

         <br> Thus, the new land relations which embodied the creation of a class of land owners and a class of
        cultivators (whether on a tenancy basis or a daily wage) separated ownership from cultivation. The
        land lords were interested in extracting high rents leaving a pittance with the cultivators. The
        investment on land fell sharply because the cultivators had to part off with a major portion of the
        produce in the form of rent to the landlords and interest to the money lenders. This created in Indian
        agriculture a built-in-depressor. Thus, the new agrarian relations were disincentive-ridden and
        therefore, retarded the process of agricultural development.
        </p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Agriculture System in Modern India</h1>

    <p class="description">India‟s agricultural growth in the twentieth century has been low compared to that in other developing
        countries. However, there have been some important developments in the agricultural sector in this
        period. On the eve of independence, India had to face the serious problem of food shortage. The
        partition had given a severe blow to the food grain production. Food grains had to be imported from
        outside as agricultural production did not suffice with the minimum requirements of the population.
        Therefore, agricultural development was given top most priority to attain self sufficiency in food
        grains so as to feed the teeming millions. As was aptly stated by Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru after
        Independence “everything else can wait but not agriculture”, and this perspective was reflected in
        several public policies and investment decisions particularly with regard to irrigation, fertilizers,
        production, land reforms and community development. <br>

        <br> The Green Revolution in India was the outcome of the systematic application of improved agricultural
        technology for crop production. Introduction of hybrid and high yielding varieties of seeds brought
        about the real technological breakthrough in the agricultural arena. This innovation came at a critical
        juncture when India was seething under the successive droughts of 1965-66 and 1966-67. <br>

        <br> The new agricultural technologies like biotechnology and green revolution were introduced by using
        high yielding varieties, mechanization of agriculture, large scale utilization of fertilizers and pesticides
        in irrigated areas. Green Revolution did clearly exert a positive impact on the agricultural economy of
        the country. The initiatives and incentives provided to induce agricultural prosperity through new
        agricultural technology did culminate in record gain output. <br>

        <br> However, the introduction of „Green Revolution‟, agriculture has undergone many changes impacting
        the environment and society. The Green Revolution had reduced genetic diversity by promoting
        wheat rice monoculture on a narrow and alien genetic base. The major implications of „green
        revolution‟ are as follows; <br>

        <br> * Shifting cultivation, conversion of forest land to agricultural land, mono cropping and overgrazing. <br>

        <br> * With green revolution and adaptation of HYV (high yielding varieties) the application of pesticides
        has shot up substantially over time. <br>

        <br> * Through food chain, these toxic chemicals enter the livestock and human bodies and cause various
        health hazards. <br>

        <br> * Increased irrigation for rice based cropping system further enhances the existing problem of water
        logging in coastal areas. <br>

        <br> The Green Revolution of 1960s had, in its initial years, brought more cultivable land resources to the
        fold of agriculture arable land and augmented per hectare productivity of cereals. In the absence of a
        continuous follow up to the Green Revolution and the dearth of a suitable technological breakthrough
        in Indian agriculture in the Post Green Revolution Era, there has been a continuous decline in the total
        factor productivity in Indian Agriculture. India will not be able to maintain a stable food security
        system if the heartland of Green Revolution is not saved through adequate support for conservation
        farming and green agriculture.
        </p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Evolution of Plant Innovation and Protection</h1>

    <p class="description">Historically the appropriation of plant innovation was on the basis of whole organisms with respect to
        their reproductive capacity according to the plant variety rights system. The development of
        biotechnological methods to extend human inventive activity and biological description to the
        manipulation of sub-cellular components of biological systems challenged this form of plant
        appropriation. The precise means to manipulate plant biology has become part of our technical
        knowledge. The patent system itself is liable to be traced back almost five hundred years ago.
        However, it was only recently that the western world took an "inventive" approach to the patent
        regime. As a result patents have been granted for genes, proteins, biological processes as well as
        whole organisms, including varieties. The priority for the developing countries were however not on
        "inventiveness" but in the creation of new industries and "investments". <br>

        <br> The subject-matter of plant varieties is also still evolving. Mere discovery of a new variety has been
        removed as means to gain variety protection. The history of intellectual property protection for plant
        innovation is characterized by a variety of efforts to fit plant innovation into traditional regimes- trade
        mark/unfair competition regimes as well as patent regimes- followed by a gradual shift towards sui
        generis “plant variety” regimes. The sui generis regimes can best be analyzed against this mosaic of
        predecessor trademark and patent proposals. <br>

        <br> The issues of ownership and control of plant genetic resources were the source of international
        conflict at the 1992 United Nation Environmental Conference in Rio, where US opposition to
        provisions on intellectual property rights in a proposed international treaty on biodiversity brought
        legal control of plant genetic resources to world attention.

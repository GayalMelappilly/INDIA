    </header>

    <section>
    <p class="description">Tourism in India is important for the country's economy and is growing rapidly. 
        The World Travel and Tourism Council calculated that tourism generated ₹16.91 lakh crore (US$220 billion)
         or 9.2% of India's GDP in 2018 and supported 42.673 million jobs, 8.1% of its total employment. The 
         sector is predicted to grow at an annual rate of 6.9% to ₹32.05 lakh crore (US$420 billion) by 2028 
         (9.9% of GDP). In October 2015, India's medical tourism sector was estimated to be worth US$3 billion,
          and it is projected to grow to US$7-8 billion by 2020. In 2014, 184,298 foreign patients travelled to
           India to seek medical treatment. <br>
 
         <br> Over 17.9 million foreign tourists arrived in India in 2019 compared to 17.4 million in 2018, representing
         a growth of 3.5%. This makes India the 22nd most visited nation in the world and 8th in Asia and Pacific.
         Domestic tourist visits to all states and union territories numbered 1,036.35 million in 2012, an 
         increase of 16.5% from 2011. In 2014, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh were the most popular 
         states for tourists. Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Agra and Jaipur were the five most visited cities of India 
         by foreign tourists during the year 2015. Worldwide, Delhi is ranked 28th by the number of foreign 
         tourist arrivals, while Mumbai is ranked 30th, Chennai 43rd, Agra 45th, Jaipur 52nd and
         Kolkata 90th. <br>
        
        <br> The World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Development Index 2021, which replaced its previous Travel
         and Tourism Competitiveness Report, ranks India 54th out of 117 countries overall. The last edition of
          the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report, published in 2019, had ranked India 34th out of 140
           countries overall. The report ranked the price competitiveness of India's tourism sector 13th out of 
           140 countries. It mentioned that India has quite good air transport infrastructure (ranked 33rd), 
           particularly given the country's stage of development, and reasonable ground and port infrastructure
            (ranked 28th). The country also scored high on natural resources (ranked 14th), and cultural resources
             and business travel (ranked 8th). The World Tourism Organization reported that India's receipts from
              tourism during 2012 ranked 16th in the world, and 7th among Asian and Pacific countries. <br>
        
        <br> The Ministry of Tourism designs national policies for the development and promotion of tourism. In the
         process, the Ministry consults and collaborates with other stakeholders in the sector including various 
         central ministries/agencies, state governments, union territories and private sector representatives. 
         Concerted efforts are being made to promote niche tourism products such as rural, cruise, medical and 
         eco-tourism. The Ministry of Tourism maintains the Incredible India campaign focused on promoting tourism
          in India.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Visa policy of India</h1>

    <p class="description">India requires citizens of most countries to hold a valid passport and apply for a 
        travel visa at their local Indian embassy or consulate, before their visit. Travellers can apply directly 
        by mail or in person, or through their local travel services company. India has recently implemented an 
        online method for citizens of 156 countries to apply for an e-Tourist Visa. <br>

        <br> Nationals of Bhutan, Maldives and Nepal do not require a travel visa to enter India. Citizens of 
        Afghanistan, Argentina, Bangladesh, DPR Korea, Jamaica, Maldives, Mauritius, Mongolia, Nepal, South 
        Africa and Uruguay are not required to pay a fee when obtaining an Indian visa. <br>
        
        <br> A Protected Area Permit (PAP) is required to enter the states of Nagaland and Sikkim and some parts of 
        the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Manipur, Mizoram, Rajasthan and 
        Uttaranchal. A Restricted Area Permit (RAP) is required to enter the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and parts
         of Sikkim. Special permits are needed to visit the Lakshadweep islands.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">e-Tourist Visa</h1>

    <p class="description">As a measure to boost tourism, the Indian Government implemented a new visa policy 
        in November 2014, allowing tourists and business visitors to obtain a "visa on arrival" at 28 international
         airports, by acquiring an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) online before arrival, without having to
          visit an Indian consulate or visa centre. In April 2015, the "visa on arrival" scheme was renamed
           "e-Tourist Visa" (or "e-TV") to avoid confusion. <br>

        <br> The e-Tourist Visa facility requires a tourist to apply online on a secure Government of India website, 
        at least four to thirty days before the date of travel. If approved, the visitor must print and carry the
         approved visa with their travel documents. The visa allows holders of an ETA to enter and stay anywhere 
         in India for a period of ninety days except for citizens of US, UK, Japan and Canada. Citizens of these 
         countries can stay for up to 180 days at a time. an ETA can be obtained twice in a single calendar 
         year. <br>
        
        <br> India first introduced its "visa on arrival" facility on 27 November 2014, to citizens of the following
         countries: Australia, Brazil, Cambodia, Cook Islands, Djibouti, Fiji, Finland, Germany, Indonesia, 
         Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Kiribati, Laos, Luxembourg, Marshall Islands, Mauritius, Mexico, 
         Micronesia, Myanmar, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Norway, Oman, Palau, Palestine, Papua New Guinea,
         Philippines, Russia, Samoa, Singapore, Solomon Islands, South Korea, Thailand, Tonga, Tuvalu, UAE, 
         Ukraine, USA, Vanuatu and Vietnam. On 30 July 2015, the facility was extended to China, Macau and
         Hong Kong. On 15 August 2015, the facility was further extended to citizens of Andorra, Argentina, 
         Armenia, Aruba, Belgium, Bolivia, Colombia, Cuba, East Timor, Guatemala, Hungary, Ireland, Jamaica, 
         Malta, Malaysia, Mongolia, Monaco, Mozambique, the Netherlands, Panama, Peru, Poland, Portugal,
         Seychelles, Slovenia, Spain, Sri Lanka, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Sweden,
          Taiwan, Tanzania, Turks and Caicos Islands, the United Kingdom, Uruguay and Venezuela. The facility
           should eventually be expanded to about 180 countries. <br>

       <br> As a result of the new visa policy, 56,477 tourists arrived on an e-Tourist Visa during October 2015, 
        compared with 2,705 tourist arrivals during October 2014 (just before the facility was introduced),
         representing a 1987.9% increase. During the period from January to October 2015, a total of 258,182 
         tourists arrived on an e-Tourist Visa, a 1073.8% increase on the 21,995 tourist arrivals during the
          same period in 2014 (before the e-Tourist Visa was available).</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Taj Mahal</h1>

    <p class="description">Taj Mahal, also spelled Tadj Mahall, mausoleum complex in Agra, western Uttar Pradesh
         state, northern India. The Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628-58) to 
         immortalize his wife Mumtaz Mahal (“Chosen One of the Palace”), who died in childbirth in 1631, having
          been the emperor's inseparable companion since their marriage in 1612. India's most famous and widely 
          recognized building, it is situated in the eastern part of the city on the southern (right) bank of the
           Yamuna (Jumna) River. Agra Fort (Red Fort), also on the right bank of the Yamuna, is about 1 mile 
           (1.6 km) west of the Taj Mahal. <br>
        
        <br>In its harmonious proportions and its fluid incorporation of decorative elements, the Taj Mahal is 
        distinguished as the finest example of Mughal architecture, a blend of Indian, Persian, and Islamic styles.
         Other attractions include twin mosque buildings (placed symmetrically on either side of the mausoleum), 
         lovely gardens, and a museum. One of the most beautiful structural compositions in the world, the Taj 
         Mahal is also one of the world's most iconic monuments, visited by millions of tourists each year. The
          complex was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983.</p>

    </header>

    <section>
    <p class="description">Politics of India works within the framework of the country's Constitution. India is
         a parliamentary democratic secular republic in which the president of India is the head of state & first
          citizen of India and the prime minister of India is the head of government. It is based on the federal
           structure of government, although the word is not used in the Constitution itself. India follows the
            dual polity system, i.e. federal in nature, that consists of the central authority at the centre and
             states at the periphery. The Constitution defines the organizational powers and limitations of both
              central and state governments; it is well recognised, fluid (Preamble of the Constitution being
               rigid and to dictate further amendments to the Constitution) and considered supreme, i.e. the
                laws of the nation must conform to it. <br>

       <br> There is a provision for a bicameral legislature consisting of an upper house, the Rajya Sabha 
       (Council of States), which represents the states of the Indian federation, and a lower house, the Lok
        Sabha (House of the People), which represents the people of India as a whole. The Constitution provides
         for an independent judiciary, which is headed by the Supreme Court. The court's mandate is to protect
          the Constitution, to settle disputes between the central government and the states, to settle 
          inter-state disputes, to nullify any central or state laws that go against the Constitution and to
           protect the fundamental rights of citizens, issuing writs for their enforcement in cases of 
           violation. <br>
        
       <br> There are 543 members in the Lok Sabha, who are elected using plurality voting (first past the post)
        system from 543 single-member constituencies. There are 245 members in the Rajya Sabha, out of which 233
         are elected through indirect elections by single transferable vote by the members of the state legislative
          assemblies; 12 other members are elected/nominated by the President of India. Governments are formed through
           elections held every five years (unless otherwise specified), by parties that secure a majority of members
            in their respective lower houses (Lok Sabha in the central government and Vidhan Sabha in states). India
             had its first general election in 1951, which was won by the Indian National Congress, a political party 
             that went on to dominate subsequent elections until 1977, when a non-Congress government was formed for
              the first time in independent India. The 1990s saw the end of single-party domination and the rise of 
              coalition governments. The latest 17th Lok Sabha elections was conducted in seven phases from 11 April 
              2019 to 19 May 2019 by the Election commission of India. That elections once again brought back 
              single-party rule in the country, with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) being able to claim a majority 
              in the Lok Sabha. <br>
        
         <br> In recent decades, Indian politics has become a dynastic affair. Possible reasons for this could be the
          party stability, absence of party organisations, independent civil society associations that mobilise 
          support for the parties and centralised financing of elections.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Political parties and alliances</h1>

    <p class="description">When compared to other democracies, India has had a large number of political parties 
        during its history under democratic governance. It has been estimated that over 200 parties were formed 
        after India became independent in 1947. Leadership of political parties in India is commonly interwoven
         with well-known families whose dynastic leaders actively play the dominant role in a party. Further,
          party leadership roles are often transferred to subsequent generations in the same families. 
          The two main parties in India are the Bharatiya Janata Party, commonly known as the BJP, which is the
           leading right-wing nationalist party, and the Indian National Congress, commonly called the INC or 
           Congress, which is the leading centre-left party. These two parties currently dominate national
            politics, both adhering their policies loosely to their places on the left-right political spectrum. 
            At present, there are eight national parties and many more state parties.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Types of political parties</h1>

    <p class="description">Every political party in India, whether a national or regional/state party, must
         have a symbol and must be registered with the Election Commission of India. Symbols are used in the 
         Indian political system to identify political parties in part so that illiterate people can vote by
          recognizing the party symbols. <br>

        <br> In the current amendment to the Symbols Order, the commission has asserted the following five 
        principles: <br>
        
       <br> 1. A party, national or state, must have a legislative presence. <br>
       <br> 2. A national party's legislative presence must be in the Lok Sabha. A state party's legislative presence
          must be in the State Assembly. <br>
       <br> 3. A party can set up a candidate only from amongst its own members. <br>
       <br> 4. A party that loses its recognition shall not lose its symbol immediately but shall be allowed to use 
          that symbol for some time to try and retrieve its status. However, the grant of such facility to the 
          party will not mean the extension of other facilities to it, as are available to recognized parties, 
          such as free time on Doordarshan or AIR, free supply of copies of electoral rolls, etc. <br>
       <br> 5. Recognition should be given to a party only on the basis of its own performance in elections and not 
          because it is a splinter group of some other recognized party. <br>
  
          <br>

         <br> A political party shall be eligible to be recognized as a national party if: <br>
        
      <br> 1. It secures at least six percent (6%) of the valid votes polled in any four or more states, at a 
          general election to the Lok Sabha or, to the State Legislative Assembly; and <br>
      <br> 2. In addition, it wins at least four seats in the House of the People from any State or States. <br>
      <br> 3. Or it wins at least two percent (2%) seats in the House of the People (i.e. 11 seats in the 
          existing House having 543 members), and these members are elected from at least three different 
          states. <br>

          <br>

     <br> Likewise, a political party shall be entitled to be recognized as a state party, if: <br>
        
       <br> 1. It secures at least six percent (6%) of the valid votes polled in the state at a general election,
            either to the Lok Sabha or to the Legislative Assembly of the State concerned; and <br>
       <br> 2. In addition, it wins at least two seats in the Legislative Assembly of the state concerned. <br>
       <br> 3. Or it wins at least three percent (3%) of the total number of seats in the Legislative Assembly of the
            state, or at least three seats in the Assembly, whichever is more. <br> </p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Party proliferation</h1>

    <p class="description">Although a strict anti-defection law had been passed in 1984, there has been a 
        continued tendency amongst politicians to float their own parties rather than join a broad based party 
        such as the Congress or the BJP. Between the 1984 and 1989 elections, the number of parties contesting 
        elections increased from 33 to 113. In the decades since, this fragmentation has continued.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Alliances</h1>

    <p class="description">India has a history of party alliances and breakdown of alliances. However, there are 
        three party alliances regularly aligning on a national level in competing for Government positions. The
         member parties work in harmony for gratifying national interests, although parties 
         can jump ships. <br>

       <br> * National Democratic Alliance (NDA) - Right-wing coalition led by BJP was formed in 1998 after the
         elections. NDA formed a government, although the government didn't last long as AIADMK withdrew support
          from it resulting in 1999 general elections, in which NDA won and resumed power. The coalition 
          government went on to complete the full five-years term, becoming the first non-Congress government 
          to do so. In the 2014 General Elections, NDA once again returned to powers for the second time, with a 
          historic mandate of 336 out of 543 Lok Sabha seats. BJP itself won 282 seats, thereby electing Narendra 
          Modi as the head of the government. In a historic win, the NDA stormed to power for the third term in
           2019 with a combined strength of 353 seats, with the BJP itself winning an absolute majority with 303
            seats. <br>

       <br> * United Progressive Alliance (UPA) - Centre-left coalition led by Indian National Congress (INC); this 
        alliance was created after the 2004 general elections, with the alliance forming the Government. 
        The alliance even after losing some of its members, was re-elected in 2009 General Elections with Manmohan
         Singh as head of the government. The alliance has been in the opposition since the 2014 elections, 
         with the INC being the principal opposition party, but without the official status of the Leader of 
         Opposition since they failed to win the minimum required seats. <br> </p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Corruption</h1>

    <p class="description">India has seen political corruption for decades. Democratic institutions soon became 
        federally owned, dissent was eliminated and a majority of citizens paid the price. The political 
        corruption in India is weakening its democracy and has led to the erosion of trust by the general public 
        in the political system. A good amount of money is required in elections which is source of 
        political-capitalist nexus.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Candidate selection</h1>

    <p class="description">Pre-election alliances are common in India with parties deciding to share seats. 
        This is seen mainly on a state by state basis rather than on the national level. Candidate selection 
        starts after seat sharing has been agreed by alliance fellows. <br>

        <br> Indian political parties have low level of internal party democracy and therefore, in Indian elections, 
        both at the state or national level, party candidates are typically selected by the party elites, more 
        commonly called the party high command. The party elites use a number of criteria for selecting 
        candidates. These include the ability of the candidates to finance their own election, their educational 
        attainment, and the level of organization the candidates have in their respective constituencies. Quite
         often the last criterion is associated with candidate criminality.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Local governance</h1>

    <p class="description">Panchayati Raj Institutions or Local self-government bodies play a crucial role in 
        Indian politics, as it focuses on grassroot-level administration in India. <br>

        <br> On 24 April 1993, the Constitutional (73rd Amendment) Act, 1992 came into force to provide 
        constitutional status to the Panchayati Raj institutions. This Act was extended to Panchayats in the
         tribal areas of eight states, namely Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, 
         Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Rajasthan from 24 December 1996. <br>
        
        <br> The Act aims to provide a three-tier system of Panchayati Raj for all States having a population of 
        over 2 million, to hold Panchayat elections regularly every five years, to provide reservation of seats 
        for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Women, to appoint State Finance Commission to make 
        recommendations as regards the financial powers of the Panchayats and to constitute District Planning 
        Committee to prepare a draft development plan for the district.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Role of political parties</h1>

    <p class="description">As with any other democracy, political parties represent different sections among the
         Indian society and regions, and their core values play a major role in the politics of India. Both the
          executive branch and the legislative branch of the government are run by the representatives of the 
          political parties who have been elected through the elections. Through the electoral process, the people
           of India choose which representative and which political party should run the government. Through 
           elections, any party may gain simple majority in the lower house. Coalitions are formed by the 
           political parties in case no single party gains a simple majority in the lower house. Unless a party
            or a coalition have a majority in the lower house, a government cannot be formed by that party or the 
            coalition. <br>

        <br> India has a multi-party system, where there are a number of national as well as regional parties. A 
        regional party may gain a majority and rule a particular state. If a party is represented in more than 4 
        states, it would be labelled a national party (subject to other criteria above). Out of the 72 years of
         India's independence, India has been ruled by the Congress party for 53 years as of January 2020. <br>
        
       <br> The party enjoyed a parliamentary majority save for two brief periods during the 1970s and late 1980s.
        This rule was interrupted between 1977 and 1980, when the Janata Party coalition won the election owing to
         public discontent with the controversial state of emergency declared by the then Prime Minister Indira 
         Gandhi. The Janata Dal won elections in 1989, but its government managed to hold on to power for only 
         two years. <br>
        
       <br> Between 1996 and 1998, there was a period of political flux with the government being formed first by 
       the nationalist BJP followed by a left-leaning United Front coalition. In 1998, the BJP formed the National
        Democratic Alliance with smaller regional parties, and became the first non-INC and coalition government
         to complete a full five-year term. The 2004 elections saw the INC winning the largest number of seats to
          form a government leading the United Progressive Alliance, and supported by left-parties and those
           opposed to the BJP. <br>
        
       <br> On 22 May 2004, Manmohan Singh was appointed the prime minister of India following the victory of 
       the INC and the left front in the 2004 Lok Sabha election. The UPA ruled India without the support of the
        left front. Previously, Atal Bihari Vajpayee had taken office in October 1999 after a general election
         in which a BJP-led coalition of 13 parties called the National Democratic Alliance emerged with a
         majority. In May 2014, Narendra Modi of BJP was elected as the prime minister. <br>
        
       <br> Formation of coalition governments reflects the transition in Indian politics away from the national
         parties toward smaller, more narrowly based regional parties. Some regional parties, especially in South
          India, are deeply aligned to the ideologies of the region unlike the national parties and thus the
           relationship between the central government and the state government in various states has not 
           always been free of rancour. Disparity between the ideologies of the political parties ruling the 
           centre and the state leads to severely skewed allocation of resources between the states.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Law and order</h1>

    <p class="description">Terrorism, Naxalism, religious violence and caste-related violence are important issues
         that affect the political environment of the Indian nation. Stringent anti-terror legislation such as
          TADA, POTA and MCOCA have received much political attention, both in favour and against, and some of
           these laws were disbanded eventually due to human rights violations. However, UAPA was amended in 
           2019 to negative effect vis-á-vis human rights. <br>

        <br> Terrorism has affected politics India since its conception, be it the terrorism supported from
         Pakistan or the internal guerrilla groups such as Naxalites. In 1991 the former prime minister Rajiv
          Gandhi was assassinated during an election campaign. The suicide bomber was later linked to the
           Sri Lankan terrorist group Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, as it was later revealed the killing
            was an act of vengeance for Rajiv Gandhi sending troops in Sri Lanka against them in 1987. <br>
        
        <br> The Godhra train killings and the Babri Masjid demolition on 6 December 1992 resulted in nationwide 
        communal riots in two months, with worst occurring in Mumbai with at least 900 dead. The riots were 
        followed by 1993 Bombay bombings, which resulted in more deaths. <br>
        
       <br> Law and order issues, such as action against organised crime are issues which do not affect the 
       outcomes of elections. On the other hand, there is a criminal-politician nexus. Many elected legislators 
       have criminal cases against them. In July 2008, the Washington Post reported that nearly a fourth of the 
       540 Indian Parliament members faced criminal charges, "including human trafficking, child prostitution, 
       immigration rackets, embezzlement, rape and even murder".</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">President of India</h1>

    <p class="description">The Constitution of India lays down that the Head of State and Union Executive is the 
        president of India. They are elected for a five-year term by an electoral college consisting of members
         of both Houses of Parliament and members of legislative assemblies of the states. The president is 
         eligible for re-elections; however, in India's independent history, only one president has been 
         re-elected - Rajendra Prasad. <br>

        <br> The president appoints the prime minister of India from the party or coalition which commands maximum
         support of the Lok Sabha, on whose recommendation he/she nominates the other members of the Union Council
          of Ministers. The president also appoints judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts. It is on the
           president's recommendation that the Houses of Parliament meet, and only the president has the power to 
           dissolve the Lok Sabha. Furthermore, no bill passed by Parliament can become law without the 
           president's assent. <br>
        
        <br> However, the role of the president of India is largely ceremonial. All the powers of the president 
        mentioned above are exercised on recommendation of the Union Council of Ministers, and the president does
         not have much discretion in any of these matters. The president also does not have discretion in the
          exercise of his executive powers, as the real executive authority lies in the Cabinet. The current 
          president is Ram Nath Kovind.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">The Prime Minister and the Union Council of Ministers</h1>

    <p class="description">The Union Council of Ministers, headed by the prime minister, is the body with which
         the real executive power resides. The prime minister is the recognized head of the government. <br>

        The Union Council of Ministers is the body of ministers with which the prime minister works with on a 
        day-to-day basis. Work is divided between various ministers into various departments and ministries. 
        The Union Cabinet is a smaller body of senior ministers which lies within the Union Council of Ministers,
         and is the most powerful set of people in the country, playing an instrumental role in legislation and
          execution alike. <br>
        
        <br> All members of the Union Council of Ministers must be members of either House of Parliament at the 
        time of appointment or must get elected/nominated to either House within six months of their 
        appointment. <br>
        
        <br> It is the Union Cabinet that co-ordinates all foreign and domestic policy of the Union. It exercises
         immense control over administration, finance, legislation, military, etc. The Head of the Union Cabinet 
         is the prime minister. The current prime minister of India is Narendra Modi.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">State governments</h1>

    <p class="description">India has a federal form of government, and hence each state also has its own
         government. The executive of each state is the governor (equivalent to the president of India), 
         whose role is ceremonial. The real power resides with the chief minister
         (equivalent to the prime minister) and the State Council of Ministers. States may either have a
          unicameral or bicameral legislature, varying from state to state. The chief minister and other state 
          ministers are also members of the legislature.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Nepotism in Indian politics</h1>

    <p class="description">Since the 1980s, Indian politics has become dynastic, possibly due to the absence of a
         party organization, independent civil society associations that mobilize support for the party, and 
         centralized financing of elections. One example of dynastic politics has been the Nehru-Gandhi family 
         which produced three Indian prime ministers. Family members have also led the Congress party for most of 
         the period since 1978 when Indira Gandhi floated the then Congress(I) faction of the party. The ruling 
         Bharatiya Janata Party also features several senior leaders who are dynasts. Dynastic politics is 
         prevalent also in a number of political parties with regional presence such as Bharatiya Janata Party 
         (BJP), All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK), Dravida
          Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Indian National Congress (INC), Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), Jammu & Kashmir
           National Conference (JKNC), Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party (JKPDP), Janata Dal (Secular) 
           (JD(s)), Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), National People's Party (NPP), Nationalist Congress Party (NCP),
            Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), Samajwadi Party 
            (SP), Shiromani Akali Dal (SKD), Shiv Sena (SS), Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) and Telugu Desam 
            Party (TDP)..</p>

        <h1 class="sub-heading">New Delhi</h1>
        <p class="description">New Delhi is the capital of India and a part of the National Capital Territory of 
            Delhi (NCT). New Delhi is the seat of all three branches of the government of India, hosting the 
            Rashtrapati Bhavan, Parliament House, and the Supreme Court of India. New Delhi is a municipality 
            within the NCT, administrated by the NDMC, which covers mostly Lutyens' Delhi and a few adjacent 
            areas. The municipal area is part of a larger administrative district, the New Delhi district. <br>

            <br> Although colloquially Delhi and New Delhi are used interchangeably to refer to the National Capital 
            Territory of Delhi, these are distinct entities, with both the municipality and the New Delhi district
             forming a relatively small part of the megacity of Delhi. The National Capital Region is a much 
             larger entity comprising the entire NCT along with adjoining districts in neighbouring states, 
             including Ghaziabad, Noida, Gurgaon and Faridabad. <br>
            
            <br> The foundation stone of New Delhi was laid by George V during the Delhi Durbar of 1911. It was 
            designed by British architects Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker. The new capital was inaugurated on
             13 February 1931, by Viceroy and Governor-General Irwin.</p>

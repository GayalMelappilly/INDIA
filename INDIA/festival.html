    <section>
    <p class="description">Indian people present several cultural festivals according to their own
         cultures. Basically the four major religion groups of India namely Hinduism, Islam, Christianity and 
         Sikhism celebrate several colorful religious festivals in every year. <br>

         <br> Festival is a celebration of life. It brings peace and joy to the masses and breaks the monotony of life.
         We can divide festivals of India in three types - national, religious and seasonal.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">National Festivals</h1>

    <p class="description">National festivals, like the Republic Day, the Independence Day, Gandhi Birthday are
         celebrated with great patriotic fervor. These days have been declared as national holidays and are 
         celebrated in all parts of the country with a lot of enthusiasm. <br>

        <br> On the Republic Day and the Independence Day, there are some formal events taken by governments, including
         a march-past and flag-hoisting in all the state capitals, district headquarters, corporations and 
         municipalities, gram panchayats... and so it goes. <br>
        
        <br> Gandhi Jayanti and Children's Day are more muted. Gandhi Jayanti is officially significant but does not 
        evoke the same response from the people as Independence Day and Republic Day.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Religious Festivals</h1>

    <p class="description">The religious festivals of India include Dussehra, Diwali, Janmastami, Shivratri, 
        Ram Navami, Holi, Navarati, Eid-ul-Zuha, Eid-ul-fitr, Christmass, Buddha Purnima, Mahavir Jayanti and
         the festivals of the Parsees and the Jews. <br>

        <br> There is a big list of the religious festivals that are celebrated in India. There are a number of 
        religions believer lived together in India and they celebrate their festivals in their won custom. <br>
        
        <br> People of Hindu religious celebrate light up their homes with as many lights on Diwali. The colors of 
        Holi are spread across the castes and creeds. On the occasion of Raksha Bandhan an unspoken promise is
         exchanged between a brother and sister. They also celebrate Ram Navami, Maha Shivratri, Janamashtami 
         etc. <br>
        
        <br> The Islamic festivals are celebrated according to the Muslim or the hijri calendar. The month long fasting
         is completed with Eid-ul-fitr. The other Islamic festivals are Barah Wafat, Haj, Id-Ul-Azha, Muharram and
          Sair-E-Gul Faroshan etc. <br>
        
        <br> Christian religious festivals in the country have the entire color that is found in Indian celebrations.
         This is especially true of the festivals associated with particular shrines, such as Vailankanni in
          Tamil Nadu. They celebrate Christmas, Holy Week, Virgin Mary Feast and St.Thomas Mount Feast etc. <br>
        
       <br> Besides Hindu, Muslim and christen there have many other religious (Jain Festivals, Buddhist festivals 
        and Sikh Festivals etc.) and they celebrate their religious festivals in their way.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Seasonal Festivals</h1>

    <p class="description">The seasonal festivals are celebrated in different ways all over the country. 
        Seasonal changes mark the new beginnings. Happiness fills the heart of the people during these 
        festivals. <br>

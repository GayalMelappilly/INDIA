    </header>


    <section>
    <p class="description">The languages of India primarily belong to two major linguistic families, 
        Indo-European (whose branch Indo-Aryan is spoken by about 75 percent of the population) and Dravidian 
        (spoken by about 25 percent). Other languages spoken in India come mainly from the Austro-Asiatic and 
        Tibeto-Burman linguistic families, as well as a few language isolates. Individual mother tongues in India
         number several hundred, and more than a thousand if major dialects are included. The SIL Ethnologue
          lists over 400 languages for India; 24 of these languages are spoken by more than a million native 
          speakers, and 114 by more than 10,000. Three millennia of political and social contact have resulted 
          in mutual influence among the four language families in India and South Asia. Two contact languages have 
          played an important role in the history of India: Persian and English. <br>
        
        <br>While Hindi is the official language of the central government in India, with English as a provisional 
        official sub-language, individual state legislatures can adopt any regional language as the official
        language of that state. The Constitution of India recognizes 23 official languages, spoken in different 
        parts of the country, and two official classical languages, Sanskrit and Tamil.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Official Languages</h1>

    <p class="description">India has "Official Languages” at the state and central levels but there is no one
         "national language." Hindi is the official language of the central government in India, with English as a
          provisional official sub-language. Individual state legislatures can adopt any regional language as the
           official language of that state. <br>
        
        <br>Article 346 of the Indian Constitution recognizes Hindi in Devanāgarī script as the official language 
        of central government India. The Constitution also allows for the continuation of use of the English 
        language for official purposes. Article 345 provides constitutional recognition as "Official languages" 
        of the union to any language adopted by a state legislature as the official language of that state. Until 
        the Twenty-First Amendment of the Constitution in 1967, the country recognized fourteen official regional
         languages. The Eighth Schedule and the Seventy-First Amendment provided for the inclusion of Sindhi, 
         Konkani, Manipuri and Nepali, increasing the number of official regional languages of India to 18. 
         Individual states, whose borders are mostly drawn on socio-linguistic lines, are free to decide their
          own language for internal administration and education. In 2004, the government elevated Tamil. to the 
          newly created official status of "Classical Language," followed by Sanskrit in 2005. <br>
        
        <br>The Constitution of India now recognizes 23 languages, spoken in different parts of the country. 
        These consist of English plus 22 Indian languages: Assamese, Bengali, Bodo, Dogri, Gujarati, Hindi, 
        Kannada, Kashmiri, Konkani, Maithili, Malayalam, Meitei, Marathi, Nepali, Oriya, Punjabi, Sanskrit, 
        Santhali, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu. Hindi is a official language of the states of Uttar Pradesh, 
        Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttaranchal, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and the
         National Capital Territory of Delhi. Tamil is an official language of Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Andamon
          Nicobar Islands. English is the co-official language of the Indian Union, and each of the several states
           mentioned above may also have another co-official language.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Hindi and English</h1>

    <p class="description">The Indian constitution declares Hindi in Devanagari script to be the official language
         of the union. Unless Parliament decided otherwise, the use of English for official purposes was
          officially to cease after the constitution came into effect, on January 26, 1965. The prospect of the 
          changeover led to much alarm in the non Hindi-speaking areas of India, as a result of which Parliament
           enacted the Official Languages Act, 1963, providing for the continued use of English for official
            purposes along with Hindi, even after 1965. An attempt was made in late 1964 to expressly provide 
            for an end to the use of English, but it was met with protests from across the country, some of 
            which turned violent. Widespread protests occurred in states such as Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal,
             Karnataka, Pondicherry and Andhra Pradesh. As a result of these protests, the proposal was dropped,
              and the Act itself was amended in 1967 to provide that the use of English would not be ended until a 
              resolution to that effect was passed by the legislature of every state that had not adopted Hindi as
               its official language, and by each house of the Indian Parliament.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Language Families</h1>

    <p class="description">The languages of India may be grouped by major language families. The largest of these
         families in terms of speakers is the Indo-European family, predominantly represented in its Indo-Aryan
          branch (accounting for some 700 million speakers), but also including minority languages such as 
          Persian, Portuguese or French, and English spoken as lingua franca. The second largest is the Dravidian
           family, accounting for some 200 million speakers. Minor linguistic families include the Munda with 
           approximately nine million speakers, and Tibeto-Burman families with approximately six million 
           speakers. There is also a language isolate, the Nihali language.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">History of Languages in India</h1>

    <p class="description">The northern Indian languages from the Calestini family evolved from Old Indo-Aryan
         such as Sanskrit, by way of the Middle Indo-Aryan Prakrit languages and the Apabhramsha of the Middle
          Ages. There is no consensus on the specific time when the modern north Indian languages such as Hindi,
           Marathi, Punjabi, and Bengali emerged, but 1000 C.E. is commonly accepted. The development of each 
           language was influenced by social and political contact with foreign invaders and speakers of the other
            languages; Hindi/Urdu and closely related languages were strongly influenced by Persian 
            and Arabic. <br>

         <br> The South Indian (Dravidian) languages had a history independent of Sanskrit. The origins of the Dravidian
          languages, as well as their subsequent development and the period of their differentiation, are unclear, 
         and adequate comparative linguistic research into the Dravidian languages is lacking. Inconclusive
          attempts have also been made to link the family with the Japonic languages, Basque, Korean, Sumerian,
           the Australian Aboriginal languages and the unknown language of the Indus valley civilization. However,
            in later stages, all the Dravidian languages were heavily influenced by Sanskrit. The major Dravidian 
            languages are Telugu, Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam. <br>
        
        <br> Bengali arose from the eastern Middle Indic languages of the Indian subcontinent. Magadhi Prakrit, the 
        earliest recorded spoken language in the region, had evolved into Ardhamagadhi ("Half Magadhi") in the 
        early part of the first millennium C.E.. Ardhamagadhi, as with all of the Prakrits of North India, began 
        to give way to what are called Apabhramsa languages just before the turn of the first millennium. The local
         Apabhramsa language of the eastern subcontinent, Purvi Apabhramsa or Apabhramsa Abahatta, eventually 
         evolved into regional dialects, which in turn formed three groups: the Bihari languages, the Oriya 
         languages, and the Bengali-Assamese languages. Some argue for much earlier points of divergence, going 
         back to as early as 500 C.E., but the language was not static; different varieties coexisted and authors 
         often wrote in multiple dialects. <br>
        
        <br> The Austroasiatic family of languages includes the Santal and Munda languages of eastern India, Nepal, and 
        Bangladesh, along with the Mon-Khmer languages spoken by the Khasi and Nicobarese in India and in Myanmar,
         Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and southern China. The Austroasiatic languages are thought to have
          been spoken throughout the Indian subcontinent by hunter-gatherers who were later assimilated first by 
          the agriculturalist Dravidian settlers and later by the Indo-Europeans from Central Asia. The
           Austroasiatic family is thought to have been the first to be spoken in ancient India. Some believe the
            family to be a part of an Austric superstock of languages, along with the Austronesian language 
            family. <br>
         
        <br> According to Joseph Greenberg, the Andamanese languages of the Andaman Islands and the Nihali language of
         central India are thought to be Indo-Pacific languages related to the Papuan languages of New Guinea, 
         Timor, Halmahera, and New Britain. Nihali has been shown to be related to Kusunda of central Nepal. 
         However, the proposed Indo-Pacific relationship has not been established through the comparative method,
          and has been dismissed as speculation by most comparative linguists. Nihali and Kusunda are spoken by
           hunting people living in forests. Both languages have accepted many loan words from other languages, 
           Nihali having loans from Munda (Korku), Dravidian and Indic languages.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Classical Languages of India</h1>

    <p class="description">In 2004, a new language category was created by constitutional decree, under which
         languages that met certain requirements could be accorded the status of a 'classical language' in 
         India. Upon the creation of this category, Tamil and, a year later, Sanskrit, were accorded the status, 
         and more languages are under consideration for this classification. Experts consulted by the government 
         and the Sahitya Academy of India, a literary body, recommended against officially awarding the status of 
         "classical" to any language. <br>

        <br> The government has declared Tamil a classical language despite the objections of experts it consulted and 
        after a committee it had appointed refused to recommend it…. The Sahitya Akademi office bearers wrote a
         second time. In essence, they repeated that it was not the government's business to declare a language
          classical. It is a classically foolish move, a source said. <br>
        
         <br> In the mid-nineteenth century, Indologists referred to Paninian Sanskrit as "classical Sanskrit,"
         distinguishing it from the older Vedic language. Robert Caldwell, the first linguist to
          systematically study the Dravidian languages as a family, used the term "classical" to distinguish
           the literary forms of Kannada, Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam from the diglossic colloquial forms.
            In the second half of the twentieth century, academics began to suggest that the Old Tamil poems of
             the Sangam anthologies were also "classical" in the sense that they shared many features with 
             literatures commonly accepted as classical. This point, first made by Kamil Zvelebil in the 1970s,
              has since been supported by a number of other scholars, and the terminology "classical Tamil" 
              is commonly used in historical literature to refer to texts from that period. Martha Ann Selby 
              argues that if classicality is defined with reference to age and the value a literature has within 
              the tradition it represents, the Tamil poetry of the Sangam anthologies and the Maharashtri poems of
               the Sattisai are "classical," in addition to Sanskrit literature.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Writing Systems</h1>

    <p class="description">Indian languages have corresponding distinct alphabets. The two major families are
         those of the Dravidian languages and those of the Indo-Aryan languages, the former largely confined
          to the south and the latter to the north. Urdu and sometimes Kashmiri, Sindhi and Panjabi are written 
          in modified versions of the Arabic script. Except for these languages, the alphabets of Indian languages
           are native to India. Most scholars consider these Indic scripts a distant offshoot of the Aramaic 
           alphabet, although there are differing opinions.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Brahmic Script</h1>

    <p class="description">Brahmic scripts are descended from the Brāhmī script of ancient India, which may have 
        had a common ancestor with European scripts. However, some academics (see references in Rastogi 1980:88-98)
         believe that the Vikramkhol inscription is conclusive evidence that Brahmi had indigenous origins, 
         probably from the Indus Valley (Harappan) script. <br>

        <br> The most prominent member of the family is Devanagari, which is used to write several languages of 
        India and Nepal, including Hindi, Konkani, Marathi, Nepali, Nepal Bhasa and Sanskrit. Other northern 
        Brahmic scripts include the Eastern Nagari script, which is used to write Bengali, Assamese, Bishnupriya 
        Manipuri, and other eastern Indic languages, the Oriya script, the Gujarāti script, the Ranjana script, 
        the Prachalit script, the Bhujimol script and the Gurmukhi script. The Dravidian languages of southern 
        India have Brahmic scripts that have evolved making them suitable to southern needs. The earliest evidence 
        for Brahmi script in South India comes from Bhattiprolu in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh. Bhattiprolu 
        was a great centre of Buddhism during third century C.E. and from where Buddhism spread to east Asia. The
         present Telugu script is derived from 'Telugu-Kannada script', also known as 'old Kannada script', owing
          to its similarity to the same.[21] Initially minor changes were made which is now called Tamil brahmi 
          which has far fewer letters than some of the other Indic scripts as it has no separate aspirated or 
          voiced consonants. Later under the influence of Granta vetteluthu evolved which looks similar to present
           day malayalam script. Still further changes were made in nineteenth and twentieth centuries to make use
            of printing and typewriting needs before we have the present script. <br>
        
        <br> Burmese, Cambodian, Lao, Thai, Javanese, Balinese and Tibetan are also written in Brahmic scripts, 
        though with considerable modification to suit their phonology. The Siddham (kanji: 悉曇, modern Japanese
         pronunciation: shittan) script was especially important in Buddhism because many sutras were written in 
         it, and the art of Siddham calligraphy survives today in Japan.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Nastaʿlīq</h1>

    <p class="description">Nasta`līq (also anglicized as Nastaleeq; نستعلیق nastaʿlīq), one of the main genres of
         Islamic calligraphy, was developed in Iran in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. A less elaborate
          version of Nastaʿlīq serves as the preferred style for writing Persian, Pashto and Urdu. Nastaʿlīq is
           amongst the most fluid calligraphy styles for the Arabic alphabet. It has short verticals with no 
           serifs, and long horizontal strokes. It is written using a piece of trimmed reed with a tip of 5-10 mm,
            called "qalam" ("pen," in Arabic), and carbon ink, named "davat." The nib of a qalam is usually split 
            in the middle to facilitate ink absorption. <br>

        <br> After the Islamic conquest of Persia, Iranians adopted the Perso-Arabic script and the art of Arabic 
        calligraphy flourished in Iran alongside other Islamic countries. The Mughal Empire used Persian as the 
        court language during their rule over the Indian subcontinent. During this time, Nastaʿlīq came into 
        widespread use in South Asia, including Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. In Pakistan, almost everything 
        in Urdu is written in the script, concentrating the greater part of the world usage of Nasta'līq there.
         In Hyderābād, Lakhnau, and other cities in India with large Urdu-speaking populations, many street signs
          are written in Nastaʿlīq. The status of Nastaʿlīq in Bangladesh used to be the same as in Pakistan until
           1971, when Urdu ceased to remain an official language of the country. Today, only a few neighborhoods
            (mostly inhabited by Bihāris) in Dhaka and Chittagong retain the influence of the Persian and 
            Nastaʿlīq.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Romanization</h1>

    <p class="description">The National Library at Kolkata romanization is the most widely used transliteration 
        scheme in dictionaries and grammars of Indic languages. This transliteration scheme is also known as 
        Library of Congress and is nearly identical to one of the possible ISO 15919 variants.The tables below 
        mostly use Devanagari but include letters from Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam and Bengali to illustrate the 
        transliteration of non-Devanagari characters. The scheme is an extension of the IAST scheme that is used
         for transliteration of Sanskrit.</p>

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Inventories</h1>

    <p class="description">The Indian census of 1961 recognized 1,652 different languages in India 
        (including languages not native to the subcontinent). The 1991 census recognizes 1,576 classified
         "mother tongues" SIL Ethnologue lists 415 living "Languages of India" (out of 6,912 worldwide). <br>

        <br>  According to the 1991 census, 22 languages have more than a million native speakers, 50 have more than
         100,000, and 114 have more than 10,000 native speakers. The remaining languages account for a total of
          566,000 native speakers (out of a total of 838 million Indians in 1991). <br>
        
        <br> The largest language that is not one of the 22 "languages of the 8th Schedule" with official status is
         the Bhili language, with some 5.5 million native speakers (ranked 13th by number of speakers), followed 
         by Gondi (15th), Tulu (19th) and Kurukh (20th). On the other hand, three languages with fewer than one 
         million native speakers are included in the 8th Schedule for cultural or political reasons: English 
         (40th), Dogri (54th) and Sanskrit (67th).</p>
